# Giphy-Search

* Web page that allows you to search Giphy via the Giphy API for 10 gifs of a term using buttons.
* You can add your own button via the box on the right. If you try to add the same button twice, the page will prompt you to not repeat buttons, and empty the input for a new entry.

* I'm really getting the hang of jquery and javascript now, the only difficult part on this one was making the gifs play and stop on click. I did my way before the example in class showed a different method, but the results are the same.
